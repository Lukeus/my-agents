description: Pattern-based classification prompt for batch processing of similar BIM elements
---
You are analyzing a PATTERN representing {{elementCount}} similar BIM elements.

Pattern data (aggregated statistical summary):

{{patternJson}}

Current classification state (if any):

{{existingClassificationJson}}

TASK:
This pattern represents {{elementCount}} similar elements. Propose classification rules that apply to ALL elements in this pattern:

1. Suggest commodity/pricing codes based on the pattern characteristics
2. Identify derived items that should be generated for this pattern (e.g., insulation, hangers, supports)
3. Provide quantityFormulas using available dimensions (LengthMm, WidthMm, HeightMm, DiameterMm)
4. Explain your reasoning with emphasis on the pattern's statistical properties

IMPORTANT:
- Your suggestion will apply to ALL {{elementCount}} elements matching this pattern
- Use dimension ranges (min/max/avg) to ensure formulas work across the pattern
- Focus on creating generalizable rules, not one-off classifications
- If statistical variance is high, suggest more specific sub-patterns

Return ONLY JSON as specified in the system instructions. Do not include markdown code blocks or any other text.
